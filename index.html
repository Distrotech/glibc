          <p>This directory contains the sources of the GNU C Library.
See the file "version.h" for what release version you have.</p>

<p>The GNU C Library is the standard system C library for all GNU systems,
and is an important part of what makes up a GNU system.  It provides the
system API for all programs written in C and C-compatible languages such
as C++ and Objective C; the runtime facilities of other programming
languages use the C library to access the underlying operating system.</p>

<p>In GNU/Linux systems, the C library works with the Linux kernel to
implement the operating system behavior seen by user applications.
In GNU/Hurd systems, it works with a microkernel and Hurd servers.</p>

<p>The GNU C Library implements much of the POSIX.1 functionality in the
GNU/Hurd system, using configurations i[4567]86-*-gnu.  The current
GNU/Hurd support requires out-of-tree patches that will eventually be
incorporated into an official GNU C Library release.</p>

<p>When working with Linux kernels, this version of the GNU C Library
requires Linux kernel version 2.6.16 or later.</p>

<p>Also note that the shared version of the libgcc_s library must be
installed for the pthread library to work correctly.</p>

<p>The GNU C Library supports these configurations for using Linux kernels:</p>

<pre><code>i[4567]86-*-linux-gnu
x86_64-*-linux-gnu  Can build either x86_64 or x32
powerpc-*-linux-gnu Hardware floating point required
powerpc64-*-linux-gnu
s390-*-linux-gnu
s390x-*-linux-gnu
sh[34]-*-linux-gnu
sparc*-*-linux-gnu
sparc64*-*-linux-gnu
</code></pre>

<p>The code for other CPU configurations supported by volunteers outside of
the core glibc maintenance effort is contained in the <code>ports' add-on,
located in the</code>ports' subdirectory of the source tree.</p>

<pre><code>aarch64*-*-linux-gnu
alpha*-*-linux-gnu
am33*-*-linux-gnu   Not currently functional
arm-*-linux-gnueabi
hppa-*-linux-gnu    Not currently functional without patches.
ia64-*-linux-gnu
m68k-*-linux-gnu
mips-*-linux-gnu
mips64-*-linux-gnu
powerpc-*-linux-gnu Software floating point (--without-fp)
tilegx-*-linux-gnu
tilepro-*-linux-gnu
</code></pre>

<p>If you are interested in doing a port, please contact the glibc
maintainers; see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/">http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/</a> for more
information.</p>

<p>See the file INSTALL to find out how to configure, build, and install
the GNU C Library.  You might also consider reading the WWW pages for
the C library at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/">http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/</a>.</p>

<p>The GNU C Library is (almost) completely documented by the Texinfo manual
found in the <code>manual/' subdirectory.  The manual is still being updated
and contains some known errors and omissions; we regret that we do not
have the resources to work on the manual as much as we would like.  For
corrections to the manual, please file a bug in the</code>manual' component,
following the bug-reporting instructions below.  Please be sure to check
the manual in the current development sources to see if your problem has
already been corrected.</p>

<p>Please see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/bugs.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/bugs.html</a> for bug reporting
information.  We are now using the Bugzilla system to track all bug reports.
This web page gives detailed information on how to report bugs properly.</p>

<p>The GNU C Library is free software.  See the file COPYING.LIB for copying
conditions, and LICENSES for notices about a few contributions that require
these additional notices to be distributed.  License copyright years may be
listed using range notation, e.g., 2000-2013, indicating that every year in
the range, inclusive, is a copyrightable year that would otherwise be listed
individually.</p>
