{"name":"Glibc","tagline":"GlibC git://sourceware.org/git/glibc.git","body":"This directory contains the sources of the GNU C Library.\r\nSee the file \"version.h\" for what release version you have.\r\n\r\nThe GNU C Library is the standard system C library for all GNU systems,\r\nand is an important part of what makes up a GNU system.  It provides the\r\nsystem API for all programs written in C and C-compatible languages such\r\nas C++ and Objective C; the runtime facilities of other programming\r\nlanguages use the C library to access the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nIn GNU/Linux systems, the C library works with the Linux kernel to\r\nimplement the operating system behavior seen by user applications.\r\nIn GNU/Hurd systems, it works with a microkernel and Hurd servers.\r\n\r\nThe GNU C Library implements much of the POSIX.1 functionality in the\r\nGNU/Hurd system, using configurations i[4567]86-*-gnu.  The current\r\nGNU/Hurd support requires out-of-tree patches that will eventually be\r\nincorporated into an official GNU C Library release.\r\n\r\nWhen working with Linux kernels, this version of the GNU C Library\r\nrequires Linux kernel version 2.6.16 or later.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the shared version of the libgcc_s library must be\r\ninstalled for the pthread library to work correctly.\r\n\r\nThe GNU C Library supports these configurations for using Linux kernels:\r\n\r\n\ti[4567]86-*-linux-gnu\r\n\tx86_64-*-linux-gnu\tCan build either x86_64 or x32\r\n\tpowerpc-*-linux-gnu\tHardware floating point required\r\n\tpowerpc64-*-linux-gnu\r\n\ts390-*-linux-gnu\r\n\ts390x-*-linux-gnu\r\n\tsh[34]-*-linux-gnu\r\n\tsparc*-*-linux-gnu\r\n\tsparc64*-*-linux-gnu\r\n\r\nThe code for other CPU configurations supported by volunteers outside of\r\nthe core glibc maintenance effort is contained in the `ports' add-on,\r\nlocated in the `ports' subdirectory of the source tree.\r\n\r\n\taarch64*-*-linux-gnu\r\n\talpha*-*-linux-gnu\r\n\tam33*-*-linux-gnu\tNot currently functional\r\n\tarm-*-linux-gnueabi\r\n\thppa-*-linux-gnu\tNot currently functional without patches.\r\n\tia64-*-linux-gnu\r\n\tm68k-*-linux-gnu\r\n\tmips-*-linux-gnu\r\n\tmips64-*-linux-gnu\r\n\tpowerpc-*-linux-gnu\tSoftware floating point (--without-fp)\r\n\ttilegx-*-linux-gnu\r\n\ttilepro-*-linux-gnu\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in doing a port, please contact the glibc\r\nmaintainers; see http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/ for more\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nSee the file INSTALL to find out how to configure, build, and install\r\nthe GNU C Library.  You might also consider reading the WWW pages for\r\nthe C library at http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/.\r\n\r\nThe GNU C Library is (almost) completely documented by the Texinfo manual\r\nfound in the `manual/' subdirectory.  The manual is still being updated\r\nand contains some known errors and omissions; we regret that we do not\r\nhave the resources to work on the manual as much as we would like.  For\r\ncorrections to the manual, please file a bug in the `manual' component,\r\nfollowing the bug-reporting instructions below.  Please be sure to check\r\nthe manual in the current development sources to see if your problem has\r\nalready been corrected.\r\n\r\nPlease see http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/bugs.html for bug reporting\r\ninformation.  We are now using the Bugzilla system to track all bug reports.\r\nThis web page gives detailed information on how to report bugs properly.\r\n\r\nThe GNU C Library is free software.  See the file COPYING.LIB for copying\r\nconditions, and LICENSES for notices about a few contributions that require\r\nthese additional notices to be distributed.  License copyright years may be\r\nlisted using range notation, e.g., 2000-2013, indicating that every year in\r\nthe range, inclusive, is a copyrightable year that would otherwise be listed\r\nindividually.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
