/* libpthread once had its own fork, though there was no apparent reason
   for it.  There is no use in having a separate symbol in libpthread, but
   the historical ABI requires it.  For static linking, there is no need to
   provide anything here--the libc version will be linked in.  For shared
   library ABI compatibility, there must be __fork and fork symbols in
   libpthread.so; so we define them using IFUNC to redirect to the libc
   function.  */
